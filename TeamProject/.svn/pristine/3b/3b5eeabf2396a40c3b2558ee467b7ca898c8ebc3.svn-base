 * The <code>Primary Weapon</code> class extends the generic Weapon class. It defines the data that each Primary Weapon below

 * first Weapon slot, which will be accessed by pressing the '1' key on the keyboard. This will be the clientPlayers
 * strongest weapon and will be primarily what they will use.

	 * This is the constructor for creating a new <code>Primary Weapon</code> which takes nine parameters, which
	 * when combined completely define the behaviour of the weapon - how it will fire, how much damage it will do,
	 * etc. Primary Weapons will be the clientPlayers main defence against enemies.
	 * 
	 * @param accuracy the accuracy of the weapon; the lower the accuracy the more random the projectiles will be.
	 * @param damage the damage of the weapon - this is the amount it will do to the enemies health on hit.
	 * @param cooldown the time it takes in ms between shots; a cooldown of 100 is 10 projectiles per second.
	 * @param range how far the projectiles fly before dropping.
	 * @param numProjectiles how many projectiles are fired on each shot.
	 * @param projectileSpeed how fast the projectiles fly.
	 * @param reloadTime the time it takes in ms for the gun to reload after the entire magazine is expended.
	 * @param magSize the number of projectiles per magazine.
	 * @param maxAmmo the maximum ammo the player should be able to hold at any one time for this weapon.
